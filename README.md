## For Developers

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Required Python packages (automatically installed by the build script)

### Building from Source

#### Method 1: Automated Build (Recommended)

The easiest way to build the application is using the automated build script:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yt-dlp-gui.git
cd yt-dlp-gui
```

2. Run the build script:
```bash
python build.py
```

The build script will:
- Check if Python is installed and install it if needed
- Install required Python packages
- Download the latest yt-dlp and FFmpeg binaries
- Build the application using PyInstaller
- Create platform-specific packages (EXE for Windows, DMG for macOS, AppImage for Linux)
- Clean up temporary files

The built packages will be located in the `dist` folder.

#### Method 2: Manual Build

If you prefer to build manually:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yt-dlp-gui.git
cd yt-dlp-gui
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the required binaries:
```bash
python yt_dlp_gui/fetch_binaries.py
```

4. Build the application:
```bash
pyinstaller yt_dlp_gui.spec
```

5. The built executable will be in the `dist` folder.
